# Rebel - Mania (Physical Boss)
## Difficulty Rating: C

![Rebel](https://i.ibb.co/jLZgMrf/dnplayer-Nc9-Il100-BW.png)

### Noteable Mechanics
1. Banished Spear **(!)** - Throws a spear at your sinner with the **highest** Attack, that deals damage continously in a 3x3 area.
> Tip: Place your highest Attack sinner in the top right corner (Marked O). After the boss throws the spear on them, move them back to a more favourable position.
2. Raging Blizzard **(!)** - Massive AOE damage if core is not broken quickly enough.
> Tip: Break as fast as possible, if you are unable to do so and are dying to this Attack. Consider bringing a healer.
3. Deadly Tsunami - Unavoidle AOE damage. Will perform after reaching 80% or lower HP, and after recovering from break.
4. Piercing Icicle - High single target damage to your highest HP unit.
> Tip: You can avoid this damage by moving. However, it's not really scary enough to demand it.
5. Mania Rift - Summons 3 Sand Worms (each with 3x cores)
> Tip: Bring Labyrinth 

## Stage

### Enemies of Note
**HUSH-8** - The big guys reveal their cores after losing roughly 20% of their HP. When they do, they will also generate a 3x3 shield, which negates Normal Attack damage from sinners *outside* the shield. They can also stun your sinners.
> Tip: Don't rush to break the core, if it means compromising your corebreak on the boss. The boss shows his core quickly enough, that you can usually tank this elite, and break him alongside the boss.

**HUSH-47** - 2 of these guys are gonna spawn on the left hand side, away from all the action. They will teleport to the Sinner *furthest* away from them after losing 20% of their HP.
> Tip: Enemy HP -20% makes these guys jump instantly. If not available, try having a strong normal attacker lower their HP, to force them to jump to a sinner close to the boss. Break these guys sooner rather than later. (The 3rd one will spawn close to the boss, and will usually die collaterally, or at the very least be forced to teleport immediately).

> Alternatively, the two guys on the left can also be completely ignored, which may simplify the stage greatly for some people. As long as the boss is killed within a reasonable time, this still scores 240k+.

**Garden Apothecary** - Enemies with very far Attack range. 
> Tip: Avoid having a sinner standing to the right of the middle spawner as much as possible (Marked X), as this will prevent the enemies from walking forward. Once they have taken a step forward, you can place Nox down to Attack them, or kill them collaterally with something like Deren ECB.

## General Strategies

### Nox + Laby Base Package
This team is all about setting up Laby for perfection. Even if you ignore the 2 left side elites, the initial HUSH-8 spawn, alongside the boss summoning Sandworms, means we can chain together 12+ Laby ultimates during the boss' core broken duration. Dealing absolutely insane amounts of damage. I highly recommend looking up on YouTube for examples of how this can be set-up [Example Run](https://youtu.be/e2qZqn1JAYY) 

***NOTE:*** Obviously the more extra boss killing power you bring (either through amps or additional DPS) the less you need to care about perfectly chaining the Laby ults.

### Bleed
A team that can safely choose to ignore the 2 left side elites if they want. Use Levy to tank the HUSH-8's and handle the Garden Apothecarries through Dreya ECB (and/or collateral Dreya ultis).

### Coquelic
Very straightforward team, as long as Pricilla and Lady Pearl are on the team. Everything is essentially guarenteed to die within the 10 second showdown. Pearl is also an excellent solution to the Garden Apothecarries. 

### McQueen
Thanks to Laby's overwhelming boss killing power, McQueen doesn't need a ton of help killing the boss this time around. Instead, focus on maximizing the contribution of each individual clone [Example Run](https://youtu.be/y40zEgHQrV0)
